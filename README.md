This repository contains Kotlin practice files, covering various basic and advanced features of the Kotlin programming language. Each file demonstrates core concepts like control flow, collections, functions, and more. This README will guide you through setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the Kotlin files included in the repository.

Requirements
To run the Kotlin files in this repository, ensure the following are installed on your system:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK 11 or higher)
Since Kotlin runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), you'll need to have JDK installed on your system.

Check your Java version:

bash
Copy code
java -version
2. Kotlin Compiler
The Kotlin compiler is required to compile and execute Kotlin programs. You can install it using the following methods:

Using SDKMAN (Recommended):

bash
Copy code
curl -s https://get.sdkman.io | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
sdk install kotlin
Using APT on Ubuntu:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install kotlin
Verifying Kotlin installation:

bash
Copy code
kotlin -version
3. Requirement File
For easy setup, you can refer to the requirements.txt file, which lists all the necessary steps to get your environment ready.
